Introduction
------------

dell-satellite-sync is a solution for taking Dell's official Linux software repositories, replicating them into an RHN Satellite or Spacewalk server, and subscribing any registered Dell systems to the correct child channel.

The process is:

   1. rsync a copy of Dell's official repositories to a local directory
   2. For each existing base channel on the server, creates child channels that correspond to the repository for each Dell hardware system
   3. Populates each child channel with rpms from the local copy of the repositories
   4. For each registered system that has a vendor id of Dell, schedule the following actions:
         1. Install Dell's GPG keys
         2. Install smbios-utils which is used to determine the hardware specific system id
         3. Subscribe the systems to their specific child channels based on their hardware system id 

Pre-requisites
--------------

dell-satellite-sync can be run from any system that has network access to the RHN Satellite or Spacewalk server, and can be run as a non-root user.

In order for the server-side actions to complete, the following conditions must be met on the system that dell-satellite-sync is run from:

   1. The system needs access to linux.dell.com, or must already have a local copy of the entire Dell official repositories
   2. The rpm rhnpush must be installed
   3. The username and password to the RHN Satellite or Spacewalk server used must have access to create child channels under any base channels, and upload rpms via rhnpush 

For the client-side actions to complete, the following conditions must be met on the system that dell-satellite-sync is run from:

   1. The username and password to the RHN Satellite or Spacewalk server used must have access to install packages, schedule remote actions, and subscribe systems to channels
   2. All registered systems must be subscribed to their respective rhn-tools child channel
   3. The rpm rhncfg-actions must be installed
   4. Remote actions must be allowed by running rhn-actions-control --enable-run - this can be done through an rpm and pushed to the clients, or by another means outside of Satellite/Spacewalk
   5. The 'provisioning' entitlement
   6. It is recommended that they also have the osad package installed - this will allow remote actions to be executed very quickly, rather than waiting for the system to check-in 

Usage
-----

  [vinny@sat ~]$ dell-satellite-sync -h
  usage: dell-satellite-sync.py [options]
  This program will rsync an offline repository from linux.dell.com, then create 
  Satellite channels and populate them with the rpms, and subscribe registered
  clients to the correct channels.
  Use -h or --help for additional information.
  
  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -u USER, --user=USER  Satellite username
    -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
                          Satellite password (will be promoted if omitted)
    -s SATSERVER, --server=SATSERVER
                          FQDN of your Satellite server
    -l LOCALDIR, --localdir=LOCALDIR
                          local dir to hold Dell repo
    -d, --delete          delete existing Dell channels and packages
    -f, --force           force package upload
    -a, --all             subscribe all systems, whether Dell vendor or not.
    -g GPG_URL, --gpg-url=GPG_URL
                          URL where the GPG keys are located (should be
                          accessible by clients.  e.g.
                          http://satserver.example.com/pub/).
    --no-rsync            skip rsync (local repo must already be present)
    --no-packages         skip uploading packages
    -S, --server-actions-only
                          only create channels and upload rpms, skip client
                          subscription
    -C, --client-actions-only
                          only subscribe clients (channels and rpms must already
                          be on server)
    -D, --demo            enable demo mode (simulation only, does not connect to
                          a Satellite server)
    -v, --verbose         enable verbose output
    --debug               enable lots of debug output (more than verbose)

Examples
--------

Run entire process, useful options for scheduling a cron job:

[vinny@sat ~]$ dell-satellite-sync --server satellite.example.com --user satadmin --password my_password --localdir /home/vinny/dell-repo/ --gpg-url http://satellite.example.com/pub/ --force

Run server-side actions only, prompt for password:

[vinny@sat ~]$ dell-satellite-sync --server satellite.example.com --user satadmin --no-rsync --localdir /home/vinny/dell-repo/ --force --server-actions-only

Run client-side actions only, prompt for password, and display verbose output:

[vinny@sat ~]$ dell-satellite-sync  --server satellite.example.com --user satadmin --verbose --client-actions-only 

Known Issues
------------
* Currently the --force option is required when initially uploading packages from the Dell repo to the Satellite/Spacewalk server.  This is because some of the Dell rpms have the same name and version, but different checksums.  This will be corrected on the Dell repositories in the future.

* When using the --delete option, the client systems will remain subscribed to the Dell child channels.  They can easily be unsubscribed in bulk using the 'System Set Manager'.  This will be implemented into dell-satellite-sync in the future.

* Due to BZ # 530598 the Dell GPG keys are installed using a remote action.  This is because the keys are referenced using an http:// path, and as mentioned in the bug, they are not automatically imported.  In the future this step will be removed, as Satellite should automatically install the key upon initial package install.
